Answers for the 3 question :

Selection Sort:

in condition where we've sorted array and we want to add one more array (maybe sorted or not sorted) and den to get a 
complete sort of both, Selecton sort is going to start the procedure all from the first. we cant pull out the extra
benifit of having already sorted array here, thus selection sort is considered to be less adaptive in both the cases
i.e when coming array is sorted and when coming array is unsorted
and I belive the third question where user gives the input as and when he is ready turns out to be one of the above 
situation......so we can say selection sort treats any input to be the new problem, and thus not helpful in our 
condition where we have a set of already sorted array.
